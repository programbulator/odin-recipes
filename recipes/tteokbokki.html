    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tteokbokki is a popular Korean dish made from small, cylindrical rice cakes called "tteok" and a spicy chili
        sauce. The dish is typically stir-fried with vegetables, such as carrots and onions, and can also include meat
        or seafood. Tteokbokki is often served as a street food in Korea, but can also be found in restaurants and
        homes. It is considered a comfort food and is enjoyed by people of all ages. The spiciness level can vary based
        on the recipe or the eater's preference.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of cylinder shaped rice cake (tteok), bought or homemade. (Use a little more if you’re not adding
            hard boiled eggs and fish cakes)</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>7 large size dried anchovies, with heads and intestines removed</li>
        <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
        <li>⅓ cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru) aka “Korean chili flakes”</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru) aka “Korean chili flakes”</li>
        <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
        <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled (optional)</li>
        <li>½ pound fish cakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
        <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
        <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the
            anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the
            optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2½ cups.</li>
        <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake
            turns soft and the tteokbokki sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If
            the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. When you use
            freshly made rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold
            water to soften it before cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot. If you have any leftovers, just keep them in the fridge and reheat them
            when you want to eat. You should finished it in a few days.</li>
    </ol>

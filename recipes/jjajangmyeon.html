    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jjajangmyeon is a popular Korean-Chinese dish made with wheat noodles and a thick black bean sauce, typically
        made from fermented black soybeans. It is usually topped with diced meat (usually pork), vegetables, and
        sometimes seafood. The dish is said to have originated in China and was introduced to Korea during the late 19th
        century. It is considered a comfort food in Korea and is often served in restaurants specializing in
        Chinese-Korean cuisine.</p>

        <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine the potato, onion, zucchini, chili pepper, garlic, and shrimp in
            a 1½-quart (6 cups) earthenware pot or other heavy pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrap the dried anchovies in cheesecloth (or a dashi bag, a pouch for
            stock-making sold at a Korean grocery store), and put them into the pot
            with other ingredients Add water and cover.
        </li>
        <li>Cook over medium-high heat for 15 minutes until it starts boiling. If you use a stainless steel pot, it will
            take less than 15 minutes, about 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the soybean paste, mixing well. Cover and cook for 20 minutes longer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the tofu and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove the anchovy pouch and discard.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with the green onions and serve as a side dish to rice. Serve it directly from the pot, or transfer
            to a serving bowl. Everybody can eat together out of the pot, or portions can be ladled out in individual
            bowls for each person.</li>
